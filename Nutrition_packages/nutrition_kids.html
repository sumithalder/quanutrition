                <h4>Infant and Toddler Nutrition -</h4>
                <p>The first 12 months of life is the fastest growth period in a human’s life – a baby’s weight can triple by twelve months of age. Making sure your baby is fed properly is critical for normal growth and development. Breast milk is recommended as the sole source of nutrition up until about 6 months, or infant formula if unable to breastfeed. By about 12 months, your baby should be eating foods similar to those eaten by the whole family.</p>
                <p>Nutrition and child development are two terms that go hand in hand. The more nutritious diet your child consumes, the healthier he/she would be. The nutrition requirement of a child differs from that of an adult, because the child goes through a period of mental and physical development. During this phase of growth, it is important to provide the body with essential nutrients early on. Childhood in its early years is the most important time for brain development as children start to learn new things and experiment with new ideas.</p>

                <p>At Qua Nutrition, work with the paediatric nutritionist to understand your child’s non communicable concerns related to food and work on a Nutrition plan that ensures all essential nutrients and vitamins are given for the optimum growth of your child. </p>
                <h4>Children Nutrition- </h4>
                <p>Fussy eaters! Un eaten Lunch Boxes! </p>
                <p>We owe children the right to a healthy childhood that supports nutrition based growth and development. But as children grow, they develop their own individual personality, tastes and preferences to everything around them including food. An explosion of new food textures, tastes and combinations can lead them to favour a selection and ignore the others. This can be biased, and we can have a child who is skewed in a certain manner of eating that might not be favourable to his / her health.</p>
                <p>It is better to address these patterns early than late.</p>
                <p>Children also come with the unique advantage of being experimented and impressionable. And what they learn at this age, is what they hold for life. </p>
                <p>You are always worried if your child will grow as tall as you feel they should. How can you optimise the same, given their physical activities today are far lesser than what it should be ideally and there is no control on their nutrition. Children go through a growth spurt for close to 2 -3 years of their life. Their final growth spurt begins sometime between age 9-15, coinciding with their puberty. During the puberty growth spurt, boys can grow up to 4 inches a year, while girls can grow up to 3 inches a year. (For boys, puberty starts around age 11-12, and completes around age 16-17. For girls, puberty typically begins between the ages of 10-11, and is usually completed by age 15-17.). It is important for parents to focus on the right nutrition before and during the growth phase to maximise the child’s growth potential.</p>
                <p>The change in the nutritional needs during growth spurts and may be different for each child. A baby needs more calories in relation to size than a pre-schooler or school-age child, and the greatest caloric intake is required during puberty/ growth spurt time.</p>
                <p>At Qua Nutrition, our team of expert Paediatric nutritionists will provide a customized nutrition plan for your child, designed according to his/her specific activity, lifestyle, culture, taste and liking. Your child will be an integral part of this designing team so that we are sensitive to his/her choices. Based on your child’s input, we will provide your child with the nutrients that will help your child get the best all round development and height and ensure that your child also licks the last morsel of the plate!</p>
                <h3>Nutrition for Teenagers – </h3>
                <p>Oh ! They have a mind of their own. They are almost adult. Any advice is hard to follow. </p>
                <p>Teenagers have an independent life of their own and they live by their own rules. This includes eating as well. With the whole world at their feet and choices unlimited, they could be spoilt in terms of their nutrition discipline. </p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6" style="text-align: justify;border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">
                    <p>Good nutrition is critical during teenage years to support healthy growth and development. A healthy diet needs to meet the changing nutritional needs of a growing teen and importantly, helps prepare them for a lifetime of healthy eating behaviours.</p>
                    <p>Understanding teenager’s individual concerns is important before any nutritional advice. We at Qua Nutrition, look to be one of them, as we work with them that all nutrition is not a compromise of taste. There is enough fast, simple and streetfood that is tasty and good for the body. It doesn’t always have to be a battle of the good and evil in food and eating. There is a smart way to impress the parents on food habits and knowledge by working on a nutrition plan with Qua Nutrition.</p>

One area in which you are perhaps hoping to find the solutions you've been seeking, is that of nutrition.</p>
                <p>Many special needs kids have a nutritionist who sets specific guidelines for the challenges they are facing; for others, focusing on nutritional goals is a whole-family effort. Here, at Qua Nutrition, we highlight the more common nutritional risks special needs children face and provide adequate suggestions, on how to overcome these challenges. We keep in mind that nutritional challenges are as varied as each individual child, and our aim is to provide a general and specific guideline for parents and caretakers.</p>
                <p>Many children with disabilities have specific health issues that can impact their nutritional well-being and eating habits. This makes understanding and meeting your child’s nutritional needs even more important. Very often, a child with special needs may face specific barriers to having a healthy relationship with food. Many children “love” food and parents feel bad for denying them one of their pleasures but this leads to a lifelong battle of obesity and a bad relationship with food.</p>
                <p>Some 75% of kids with special needs take medication; some of the latter, especially anti-depressants, anticonvulsants, mood stabilizers, etc., are linked to weight gain. </p>
                <p style="border: 1px solid #ccc;text-align: justify; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px">The following syndromes, for instance, may place children at a higher risk for weight gain: Down syndrome, Spina Bifida, Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, Prader-Willi syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Borjeson syndrome and MOMO syndrome. </p>
                <p>Study on ages 12-18 with physical, intellectual or behavioural disabilities </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 50px;margin-bottom: 20px;">
                   <li>67.1% with autism spectrum disorder were either overweight or obese. </li>
                   <li>86.2% with Down syndrome were either overweight or obese. </li>
                   <li>18.8% with cerebral palsy were either overweight or obese. </li>
                   <li>83.1% with spina bifida were either overweight or obese. </li>
                   <li>6% with intellectual dis ability were either overweight or obese.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Special Kids Nutritional Plan is worked by a qualified and experienced paediatric Nutritionist with a panel of Nutritionists by understanding your child’s needs – which may be different from another child with the same syndrome/disease. The diet will always be individualized depending on energy requirements, any special needs for nutrients, protein, activity, mechanical issues, and behavioural issues. </p>
                <p>Overcoming the biggest nutritional challenges of special needs children can be a complex task that is sometimes within and sometimes beyond a parent's grasp. To the extent we can support, it is vital to ensure that our children enjoy the colourful, flavourful, rich-textured world of healthy food, and to get their hearts racing to the inviting rhythm of sport and life.</p>
                <p>At Qua Nutrition, our team of expert Paediatric nutritionists will provide a customized nutrition plan for your child, designed according to his/her specific condition, activity, lifestyle, culture, taste and liking. </p>

I listen to him every morning on his radio show, The Fitness Hour on Indigo 91.9 and have started taking his tips seriously for some time now. Sports being my passion and his talks together inspired me to take up a project on Teenage Fitness and Nutrition in school. I requested Ryan for some help with my project in terms of research and help with conducting a survey, etc which he readily accepted. I have been extremely lucky to have met him. He had so much knowledge to share, so many tips to give and I had so much more clarity and direction after the meeting. Together we discussed the format and skeleton of my survey. It was simply amazing to see how he answered all my questions in an easy-to-understand manner and was just so enthusiastic about helping me with my project. Just 40 mins with him and I learned so much!!</p>

I joined in August 2017 to QUA nutrition with Safa Mushtaq as dietician. Rushika had suffered viral fever since Saturday night. On preceding Monday she participated inter school tournament and she stood winner. On Tuesday she participated her Divisional tournament in which also she stood winner. Result is not important but inspite of weakness due to fever she could performed best because of nutrition chart prepared by QUA team and consistent follow up taken by you. Smooth and sweet words and motherly approach by Safa Madam with Rushika inspired her to follow diet without cheating. Rushika admits that she feels energetic after long practice sessions due to revised diet. Really I experienced the key role of nutrition in sports. Thanks to QUA and Safa Madam.</p>

Her improvement was stalled for last one year coz her body was unable to keep pace with her training sessions, full day school and her exercise regime. Her body was lacking required strength and endurance. Also recovery was not so fast. And then enters Ms. Safa Mushtaq with her magic wand !!! In matter of 1 month, my daughter's performance improved drastically. So much so that she herself couldn't belive !Thanks, Ms. Safa. The way you work with my daughter, its just amazing. You make her so comfortable in conversing with you and in the process very tactfully make her agree to have food items that she hated earlier. We are very excited to see our daughter improve so much and so fast and now can see her bright future.</p>
