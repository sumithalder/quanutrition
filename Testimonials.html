I started with cholesterol levels above normal, borderline sugar and high</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id15">  uric acid. I am very happy to report that in addition to losing around 7.5kgs in four months, all the parameters listed above became normal. I was advised a regime which I found no difficulty in following as it took into account my likes/ dislikes in food, my lifestyle and my current exercise regimen. There were course corrections made on a continual basis, depending on how I was faring. Janeline, my dietitian, was in regular touch and I felt connected. I would like to thank both Janeline and QUA for instilling a sense of ‘health consciousness’ in me.<br>&nbsp;</p>

I was not sure if qua would be able to help me lose weight as it nowehere mentioned </p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id3515">that it's a weight loss clinic rather it was all about nutrition and here I was in the dire desperation to lose weight. I wasn't bothered about nutrition at all . All I wanted was the number on the scale to go down . I went for my first meeting with them and no one in qua tried to sell any thing to me . It was quite surprising . No one said that we are running discount on 10 kg weight loss package etc. etc. I became sure that these guys are not into weight loss .I thought let me meet the dietician here and go back. That was the day I met RUHA , my nutritionist( NOT DIETICIAN) for the first time . Instead of telling me about any package or about the magic diet that qua can offer , she councelled on the importance of nutrition , body composition etc. which opened my eyes and made me aware of how weight loss and right nutrition is connected. I was told how important it is to see weight in the right perspective and not just in terms of the weighing scale .i was surprised to see how knowledgeable the nutritionists( NOT DIETICIAN) of qua are vis -a-vis of other health centres ( as I have been to many ) . That was the day I got to know the difference between a dietician and a nutritionist and trust me the difference is huge:) . I didn't give it a second thought and joined . With the blood tests that were done before I was given the diet regime I got to know that my thyroid levels are high.After following the plan, my thyroid levels drastically reduced within 4-5 months . My health showed immense improvement which was visible in my glowing skin and high energy levels . I also lost about 10 kgs in 4-5 months which was a miracle for me. My nutritionist-RUHA . I call her my star nutritionist because the credit totally goes to her . Had she not been there to spend hours on phone trying to motivate me and keep me on track I don't think I would have been able to do this . Her constant follow ups and patient listening made me follow the regime to the best possible extent and as I said the results were fabulous. Her selfless approach towards improving my health and fitness made me go back to her again and again. I think I got used to her perfectionism :) My experience has been wonderful with qua and I would totally recommend it to anyone who is conscious of their health. I highly recommend qua . If health is your priority and if you wish you live medicine free life then just blindly join qua . Trust me you will never regret your decision.<br>&nbsp;</p>

I was very skeptical if I should take the Gene test in addition to the blood test and decided</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id3518"> to skip the gene test due to its cost. I requested a nutritionist from Chennai as they would be able to provide inputs more closer to what I eat at home and there comes Lakshmi Darshini as my nutritionist. Our first interaction started off with wrong foot as I reached Qua facility in Alwarpet 1 day in advance of my original appointment and Lakshmi was very considerate to re-adjust her schedule to see me. After a thorough assessment, she provided me with a prescriptive meal plan and did regular follow-ups and gave me inputs on how I could adjust to the plan, cook the brown rice and also how to manage my run with proper hydration. I have been able to reduce about 9 Kgs of my body weight in 3 months and on my journey towards healthy lifestyle. I would have easily derailed from this journey if not for the inputs, tips and the guidance provided by Lakshmi. Overall, I am happy with the services provided by Qua Nutrition and would be recommending their services to others in need.<br>&nbsp;</p>

She was extremely insightful and very methodical and scientific in her approach! I was impressed by this,because I realized this was backed by genuine science! And, she was extremely helpful through my entire course. I must admit, Ms. Suhasini Viswanathan & QUA NUTRITION have given me a renewed energy and have made me feel all the more invigorated, so much so that I'm now confident of running the 10K in Bangalore this december. I strongly advice enrolling with them, if you really care for your body and health. Cheers to QUA, keep up the good work. And, kudos to Suhasini too!<br>&nbsp;</p>

Before giving a diet chart they did a thorough analysis of my eating habits, cultural background to the extend that even my wife was involved in the process as she use to cook the food for me. Today my diet chart include all the foods that i love to eat & thats the reason why i follow it also.

Sports being my passion and his talks together inspired me to take up a project on Teenage Fitness and Nutrition in school. I requested Ryan for some help with my project in terms of research and help with conducting a survey, etc which he readily accepted. I have been extremely lucky to have met him. He had so much knowledge to share, so many tips to give and I had so much more clarity and direction after the meeting. Together we discussed the format and skeleton of my survey. It was simply amazing to see how he answered all my questions in an easy-to-understand manner and was just so enthusiastic about helping me with my project. Just 40 mins with him and I learned so much!!<br>&nbsp;</p>

Seeing all google reviews, I was confident that they would help me in some or the other way to lose my weight in a healthy way.</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id322"> That’s what I needed from the beginning. I met Ashlin. She was my nutritionist. She heard all the issues that I had, it’s history and my lifestyle. She tailored my food in such a way that I would lose weight in a healthy way..and here I am writing this review exactly 1 month after having a consultation and following her guidance like a bible. I have lost nearly 2.4kgs in a month( I am feeling lighter, my dresses are becoming loose. I don’t under estimate the weight number that was lost. My body has responded and that’s what matter to me the most). Also my body fat percentage has reduced and several other parameters of my body are also showing/responding to the good food I am eating. I am satisfied, happy and confident that finally I am giving something to my body in return to how it has toiled with my bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle. <br>&nbsp;</p>

Qua Nutrition was suggested by my sister to try out their techniques to reduce weight due </p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id321">to the increasing risk of obesity i was going through. Ms.Suhasini, of Qua Nutrition TTK Road Chennai, an acquaintance of my sister, was mentoring me. Initially,my body mass data's, like body fat% in various parts, muscle% were recorded. And then a detail analysis of my existing food pattern was taken note of, and a suitable diet alteration to be followed was suggested, much feasible given the extra effort to avoid deviating from diet, along with proper workout schedule to be followed meticulously. Ms.Suhasini, regularly did a follow up session every week on phone, since i was unable to attend physical check-ups every week. During the monthly scheduled check-ups, my body mass data was recorded, and the progress observed through pie charts was given as comparison to contrast the actual progress, one of the important driving factors to continue further. Precisely, my target and the rate at which i was going towards it was being highlighted. Having followed the diet schedule for 6 months with as minimal deviations as possible, I was finally able to reach two digit figures of 99 kilos, which was a huge achievement of many standards for me. Presently, exactly after a year, i weigh about 85kilos, which is a decent BMI for a 6'3" guy. The confidence, and the change which was very distinctly visible physically, brought in appreciation for the effort from all around. My wholehearted gratitude to Ms.Suhasini and Qua Nutrition for having motivated me throughout this entire process. I would 100% recommend this to anyone expecting significant weight loss with constant motivation, and trust me it's worth every penny you pay for it. Not only did i lose weight, but i actually learnt what eating "healthy", and staying fit meant. Cheers to Qua Nutrition for an amazing job. <br>&nbsp;</p>

I actually started working out to reduce weight and stay fit, but, no matter how hard I tried, it was difficult losing weight and I had started developing memory problems. I got my vitamin tests done and blamed the deficiencies for being the root cause of all my health issues. This continued on for a while until I was told that QUA Nutrition provided the finest guidance related to health and nutrition and I was introduced to Shreya at QUA Nutrition. I spoke to her on the phone and we discussed everything like two old friends. It was only when I spoke to Shreya I realized how important a healthy diet was in order to lose weight as well as maintain it. We found out a lot about other underlying issues after we did my blood tests. I was surprised to learn how little things go a long way in affecting our health and well-being. I used to be a nonbeliever once upon a time, that diet plays a crucial role in weight loss, thanks to QUA, they helped me correct it. Initially, it was a little difficult to change my overall eating habits, I found out how irregular my eating habits were and I learned that I needed to eat more in order to be energetic throughout the day. I was surprised to know the amount of food required by my body. With tons of moral support from QUA and their team, especially Shreya, I managed to stick to my plan and continued to follow my schedule and exercises. There were times when I was unable to stick with the day's meals, Shreya helped me with that, she told me how to alternate between meals and how to manage to get the required calories for the day. With all the follow-up calls and agility in response from QUA Nutritions’ team I could complete my nutrition program with excellent results., and I continue to follow the charts. I am glad I was and am associated with QUA Nutrition. Looking forward to finding out and learning more about health and nutrition - for in a healthy body resides a healthy mind."<br>&nbsp;</p>

Qua Nutrition was suggested by my sister to try out their techniques to reduce weight due to the</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id24"> increased risk of obesity I was going through. Ms.Suhasini, of Qua Nutrition TTK Road Chennai, an acquaintance of my sister, was mentoring me. Initially, my body mass data's, like body fat% in various parts, muscle% were recorded. And then a detailed analysis of my existing food pattern was taken note of, and a suitable diet alteration to be followed was suggested, much feasible given the extra effort to avoid deviating from the diet, along with proper workout schedule to be followed meticulously. Ms.Suhasini, regularly did a follow-up session every week on phone, since I was unable to attend physical check-ups every week. During the monthly scheduled check-ups, my body mass data was recorded, and the progress observed through pie charts was given as comparison to contrast the actual progress, one of the important driving factors to continue further. Precisely, my target and the rate at which I was going towards it was being highlighted. Having followed the diet schedule for 6 months with as minimal deviations as possible, I was finally able to reach two digit figures of 99 kilos, which was a huge achievement of many standards for me. Presently, exactly after a year, I weigh about 85kilos, which is a decent BMI for a 6'3" guy. The confidence, and the change which was very distinctly visible physically brought in appreciation for the effort from all around. My wholehearted gratitude to Ms.Suhasini and Qua Nutrition for having motivated me throughout this entire process. I would 100% recommend this to anyone expecting significant weight loss with constant motivation, and trust me it's worth every penny you pay for it. Not only did I lose weight, but I actually learned what eating "healthy", and staying fit meant. Cheers to Qua Nutrition for an amazing job. "<br>&nbsp;</p>

I wrote to you in July earlier this year, sharing with you, my 1st ever podium finish in a 10k run. Now, I am super pleased to tell you that I won another podium</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id26"> finish but this time in a 21k at the Goa River Marathon on 11th Dec. You know, when I ran the 10k in July, I had run so fast that I could not even dream of running a kilometer more at that speed. And now when I did the 21k fairly close to that pace, my respect for Qua has gone up multifold! I have been improving in every race of mine. Here are the details. 21k in June (Aarey Mumbai Marathon) - 2.24 21k in Oct (Pune Marathon) - 2.09 21k in Dec (Goa river marathon) - 2.01 Namrata has as usual taken utmost care to give me only the best. At times, she has put her foot down and not allowed me to compromise on my nutrition chart. For eg: I detest the beetroot juice every evening. But she has been outright stubborn about it and now I know why:). The results have been amazing! My next target is to break the 2-hour barrier and I continue to train hard for it. My biggest learning now is: Never argue with your nutritionist if you want the best results. Some things have to be eaten just like medicine. And the effort is totally worth it. I am no longer apologetic about carrying my nutrition goodie bag even when I am visiting friends and family. So thank you once again Qua for getting me fitter at 45! Raring to go like never before!"<br>&nbsp;</p>

I know the man behind this company as a</p><p class="mt-0 mb-0 p-10 pt-0 text-center collapse" id="block-id27"> personal friend and hence knew that this would be no Con job. What really impressed me is that in order to make sure that I was serious about the whole experience, he refused to counsel me directly, and instead handed my sessions to one of their trained Nutritionists/Dietitians. I must say that I have been tremendously impressed with the seriousness with which they take their work and their levels of involvement with me. I am based in Goa and hence do not have the luxury of face to face meetings with the team. However that has been of no hindrance, as for right from the start, they coordinated a home visit by a lab to collect all the blood and urine samples required to begin the tests on which their analysis of my health and metabolism patterns would be based. Less than a week later, I had a 2 and a half hour phone session wherein my lab reports were explained, important health issues highlighted, and my detailed dietary intake patterns and exercise patterns were discussed. Following that a detailed dietary plan was provided and explained along with recommended supplements to cope with deficiencies discovered, and to target specific aims such as fat loss etc. What was really nice was that the new recommendations were based on my existing dietary habits, incorporating the types of foods I would usually prefer to eat, adding simple changes that I would easily manage (such as fruits between meals etc.) and very importantly, an awareness building of the different types of food categories (protein/carbs/vitamins etc.) and their recommended quantities to provide for a balanced diet as well as a fat burning diet. I for one made it a point to record details of all exercises done, food and their quantities are taken in on a daily basis, and provided this to my dietitian on a weekly basis. Every week small changes were recommended and incorporated, helping me become more aware of the gaps between my meals, the healthy substitutes for between meal snacks, and the importance of the need to exercise more. I have lost about 4 kilograms so far and have begun to get a far more toned and athletic body than what has been over the last few years. With another two months to go, I am really looking forward to the results of this program and am also happy that eating healthy and eating proper portions is coming more and more naturally to me. For the money put into this program, I can confidently say that it is worth well more than what it cost me as I have a healthier fit self to live with now! Thanks, Ryan Fernando and the Qua Nutrition team!"<br>&nbsp;</p>

I got to know about Ryan and Qua through a friend. Ryan was very helpful and connected me to their clinic in Chennai.
